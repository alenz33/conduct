CONvenient Construction Tool
============================

conduct is a build system that is intended to be used as a standalone script (conduct.py) or in conjunction with some load balancer (e.g. via Jenkins).

The idea is to checkout/install conduct to some system, give it a build chain config and the necessary parameters, and everything else shall be done automatically. That means:

        Bootstrapping of necessary tools
        Configuring necessary tools
        Building by using the given chain config and parameters
        Cleanup after the build
        Rollback the boostrapped packages (if desired)

Basically, conductâ€™s goals are:

        easy to configure the build process
        easy to use the build process
        easy to extend for special needs
        consistent logging
        automatic boostrapping
        great selection of standard build steps
